# SneakDoc
 Web Projet London

For our project you will be able to use the sql script that will initialise the db, you will have buyer / seller and administrator accounts at your disposal. 

Admin account: yassineadmin@gmail.com
Seller account: yassineseller@gmail.com
Buyer account: yassinebuyer@gmail.com

you will have the password for each account in the "pwd" column. 

Then, when you enter the site, you will have two choices (to use the site correctly). 

Sign-in and Sign-up (the use of sign-up is intuitive)

For Sign-in, you must select whether you are going to connect as a seller, buyer or administrator and then enter the correct identifiers (Mail and Pwd).

Once you have entered the site with the different accounts you can see that the navigation bar for the different types of user is different. A buyer only has access to the functions that correspond to him. A seller is like a buyer but he has access to the "sale" category and the admin has access to everything that the seller has access to with the addition of the "Admin" category.

as users: you will be able to access the purchase category, where you can see all the products stored in the site's database. We have also enabled the use of images. You can add a product to a "buy_now" product in your cart and pay for it

You also have the right to consult your personal details (address, first and last name, telephone number, etc.). If you decide to change them, simply change them in the text zone and the database will automatically update to the user's line. (this feature is available for all users of all types)
you can also log out by clicking on the logout button (also available for all users).

As a seller, you can do everything that a buyer can do, but you can also sell a product. To do this, simply go to the "sell" category and enter the product details (you can even add a photo that will be stored in the database, the path to the image will be stored in the database with the product to which it relates and the image itself will be stored in your image folder at the root).

You can then fill in all the other characteristics of your product, which will also be stored in the database. 

As a seller, you'll be entitled to one last feature: the ability to delete products (only if you're the seller!). To do this, simply go to the "remove" section and click on the "delete" button, which will remove the product from the database and adapt the display accordingly. 

As administrator, you'll have access to all the seller's functionalities, but you'll also have access to two main features: the admin category, which lets you manage users and delete them simply by entering their id, and the ability to create new users simply by entering an e-mail address (not already in the database) and the user's password.

as administrator, when you want to remove a product from the market, you'll be able to see absolutely all the products in the database.

you can buy a buy_now product. You just have too add the product to your cart and then confirm the payment directly in the cart part and then if the paiement information of the current user correspond in the database the product is suppress

something we failed to do: 

Sort products in the purchase category
